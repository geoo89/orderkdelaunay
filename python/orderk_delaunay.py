    The constructor takes a list of input points (with a point represented as
    a list of its coordinates) and an order. The point set can be in
    Euclidean space of any dimension. Upon construction, the order-k Delaunay
    mosaics of the points set from order 1 up to the specified order are
    computed. The result can be accessed via the public attributes of the
    OrderKDelaunay instance.

    Public attributes:

            List of vertex lists.
            For each order-k Delaunay mosaic from 1 up to order, the list
            of vertices where each vertex is a k-tuple of point indices.
        diagrams_simplices:
            List of simplex lists.
            For each order-k Delaunay mosaic from 1 up to order,
            the list of top-dimensional simplices of a triangulation of the
            mosaic, where each simplex is a (d+1)-tuple of indices into the
            corresponding vertex list.
        diagrams_cells:
            List of cell lists.
            For each order-k Delaunay mosaic from 1 up to order,
            the list of top-dimensional cells of the mosaic, where each cell
            is a tuple of vertices (i.e. k-tuples of point indices) which spans
            the cell (i.e. the convex hull is convex hull of the vertices).
        diagrams_generations:
            List of generation lists.
            For each order-k Delaunay mosaic from 1 up to order,
            the list of generations of the top-dimensional cells of the mosaic,
            i.e. each cell from diagrams_cells is associated a generation.
